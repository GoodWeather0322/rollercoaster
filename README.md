# Roller Coaster Animation
Project 3/4: Roller Coaster 

Created an OpenGL program that creates a 3D world, and to allow the user to place a train (or roller coaster) track in the world. First person and third person views are both supported. The user is able to see and manipulate a set of control points that define the curve that is the track, and draw the track and animate the train moving along the track. </br>
Fundamentals used include Control Point manipulation to create curves, arc length parameterization, physic world gravity manipulation, etc. </br> </br>
